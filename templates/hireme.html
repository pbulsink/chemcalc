          <p><h2>Hire Me!</h2></p>
          <p>Are you looking for a chemist who knows how to program? A programmer who
          understands the complex nature of science? Your search is over!</p>
          <p>My education includes a Master's degree in Chemistry from the University
          of Ottawa, and a Bachelor of Science in Honour's
          Chemistry, Co-op, with a Music Minor, from the University of Waterloo in 2012.</p>
          <p>My experience includes more than two years of in-laboratory chemical research,
          in inorganic, computational, and materials chemistry. My experience includes
          programming to assist data handling, and modification of software operating analytical equipment.
          This has taught me the ability to attack large scale problems in a strategic way, and
          develop the skills and connections I need to find solutions.</p>
          <p>I have a growing passion for open science initiatives and feel that it is
          important to bridge the gap between scientists and technology.</p>
          <p>My programming projects can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/pbulsink">GitHub</a>.
          <p>Accuracy, attention to detail, and the importance of quality control
          are deeply engrained in me from experience in analytical laboratory settings.</p>
          <p>My programming knowledge is a mix of home-grown and some course work. Using Udacity, Coursera, 
	  on-campus classes, and Google, I've been able to build this and a few other websites.</p>
          <p>More detail on my skills, education, 
	and experience can be found in my resume.</p>
